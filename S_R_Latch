Bistable multivibrator has 2 stable states [bi], set - S & reset - R => set-reset
or S-R latch. Wire 2 NOR gates so that the out of one of them feeds back to the 
input of another and the same does the other latch. => Outputs are in opposite states. 
If S and R has the same value and it =1 => result in Q & !Q  = 0. It is also known as 
invalid or illegal state for the S-R multivibrator. S=1 R=0 => set the multivibrator =>
Q=1 !Q=0. R=1 S=0 => reset the multivibrator.Q&!Q in the same state => invalid condition,
unstable with S&R inputs inactive, circuit stabilize <=> S or R condition as one 
gate [relay,coil] is bound to react with a different speed than other. Both identical =>
oscilate between high and low as a astble multivibrator non reaching of a stability.
Not stable [continually oscillating] condition is rare. The state of circuit is 
unpredictable after power-up if there is a cycle or 2 of the oscillation. The basic 
problem is race condition [occurs if 2 mutually-exclusive events are initiated at the same
time through different circuit elements by a single cause]  between 2 relays. Here
multy-exclusive event is the de-energized state of relays. If one relay is de-energized,
interlocking happens in order not to latch both relays, and if both relays de-energize, 
both relays race to latched as recive power but  through the closed contact will ceep the other 
relay switched on [ energized] => maintaining the circuit in one of the states.The winer is
defined by the physical characteristics of the relays and not the circuit design.It is 
possible to avoid the unpredictable condition using time-delay relay to disable one of the competing 
relays for a short time, so as the circuit powers up, the time-delay relay contact and delays
closing for  second and the same au conrai. In any sequential system it's a problem for detecting and 
eliminating. These latches are wide used in motors!
