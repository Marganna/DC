CLOCK

 Clock provides pulse in the electronics. Clock signal regulates to flow of logic signals 
so the system can run the optimum speed. [signal to define the speed]. 
 Clock == a device which generates periodic signal for timing.
 Any system requires a reference time for synchronization, command execution and data transfer.
 Clocks connected to anything that processes a signal in the digital device.
 Clocking network provides the frequency inputs to the various devices within a system allowing them to 
perform instendet functionality.

Crystal == device of quartz + packageing arround it. passive circuit requires an oscilation circuit
to produce useful signal. [passive circuit+oscil. circuit]

Signal chain or signal - processing chain used in processing & mixed signal system design. 

Oscilator == crystal+oscilation circuit, which provides a signal with logic level output oscilator is 
an independent clock source.

 A clock receives or distributes a frequency or generates new to send as outputs to the devices using 
phase locked loop [PLL] or non-PLL based circuitry.
 PLL when a system needs to minimize the propagation delay is able to do as a phase detector to keep
an input clock in a phase with an incoming freaquency through the use of a feedback loop.
 Non-PLL used when the time delay between source and output is not important to the system.

CLOCK FUNCTIONS

Fan out buffers

Distributes multiple outputs at the same frequency. Cpuld be PLL based & non-PLL
 
Multipliers/Dividers  

Clock which is able to transient input clock into an output clock with a higher [multiplier] or
lower [divider] frequency which could be PLL or NON-PLL

Sybthesizers

Contains one or more PLLs it receives a stimulus usually a low frequency signal from a crystal & 
generates multiple outputs with different [int. or fractional] frequencies.

Jitter

Cleanes any PLL based clock which cleans the noise from reference check & provides clean and sync. 
Clock from the receivers VCO or internal VCO.

Output Skew

Difference between 2 propagating delay times when input switching causes multiple out switching.

Propagation delay tpd.

Between the specified reference points on the input and output voltage move wave forms one output
changing from one difference level to another [from high to low or au conrai].
